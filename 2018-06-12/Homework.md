For homework there are 3 changes to make to our RPS game.

1. Change all functions to use the arrow function syntax.
2. Factor out the logic to check if a player has won into its own function.
3. Modify the play game function to take a third parameter, `rounds`, that controlls the number of rounds a player needs to win to win the game.
