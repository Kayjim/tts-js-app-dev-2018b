Create an Array named superHeroes

Inside the superHeroes array create the following objects: 
{hero:"Batman", identity: "Bruce Wayne"}
{hero:"Spiderman", identity: "Peter Parker"}
{hero:"The Flash", identity: "Barry Allen"}

Map over the superHeroes to get an array like: ["Batman is Bruce Wayne", "Spiderman is Peter Parker", "The Flash is Barry Allen"];
*Hint1: create a function that does this for one superhero name and then use map on the array to get all of the requested arrays*

Join the entries in the resulting array and log them to the console.

Should log "Batman is Bruce Wayne, Spiderman is Peter Parker, The Flash is Barry Allen"
