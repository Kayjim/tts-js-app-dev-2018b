# Homework

For this homework you'll be constructing a module with 3 functions. Each homeworkX.js file builds on the last so that to be able to run each script you should add the following functions:
- homework1.js : getPost - should take a post id and return a promise for the request to the typicode endpoint we used in class. (*use request-promise*)
- homework2.js : logTime - should log the time formatted as `h:mm:ss a` (*use moment*)
- homework3.js : prettyPrint - should return a string like JSON.stringify but the keys should be one color and properties another color (*use chalk*)
